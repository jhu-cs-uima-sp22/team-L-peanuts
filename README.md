**State of App:**

The app functions properly. Nearly all of our original sprint 1 tasks were completed. We just did not get a chance to implement the edit foods page since we were still working retreving data from the Foods database.

**Completed Pages:**

-Login and signup screens

-Editing restrictions page

-Profile page

-Settings page

-Add page

**Complete Features:**

-Login and signup stores user information in a database. A user can submit and change their own restrictions to be stored in the database.

-The profile page displays the general view of what their profile looks like, including restrictions, name, email, and a foods section.

-The settings page functions properly, allowing user to change name or password.

-All features of the add page view is completed. New created posts are added to a Foods database.
