**State of App:**

The app functions properly. All of our original sprint 2 tasks were completed. All the pages are completed, but we are working on finding and fixing any bugs. 

NOTE: 

-sometimes images do not load, but they are stored and retrieved correctly.

-for the check lists, if the user selects done too quickly, the response might not have been retrieved because the emulator was slow.
