**State of App:**

The app functions properly. Nearly all of our original sprint 1 tasks were completed. We just did not get a chance to implement the edit foods page since we are still working on getting the add foods page working.

**Completed Pages:**

-Login and signup screens

-Editing restrictions page

-Profile page

-Settings page

-Add page

**Complete Features:**

-Login and signup stores user information in a database. A user can submit and change their own restrictions to be stored in the database.

-The profile page displays the general view of what their profile looks like, including restrictions, name, email, and a foods section.

-The settings page functions properly, allowing user to change name or password.

-The add page view is completed. Just working on connecting a created food with the database and displaying it under the foods section of profile.
